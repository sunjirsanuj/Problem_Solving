In the Coin Change problem, we are given a target value T
and a set of specific coin denominations, each available
in infinite supply. The task is to determine the minimum
number of coins required to make the value T using any
combination of the given coins. If it is not possible to
form the target value with the available coins,the output
should indicate that it cannot be formed. The goal is to find
an optimal combination that achieves the target with the least number of coins.
