In the 0/1 Knapsack problem, we are given a set of items where each item has a specific weight and profit,
along with a knapsack that can carry a maximum weight W. The task is to select a subset of these items such
that the total profit is maximized without exceeding the weight capacity of the knapsack. Each item can
either be taken completely (1) or not taken at all (0), meaning we cannot break an item into fractions.
The goal is to choose the most profitable combination of items while staying within the allowed weight limit.
