In the Edit Distance problem, we are given two strings,
and the task is to determine the minimum number of
operations required to convert the first string into the second.
The allowed operations are insertion, deletion, and substitution
of characters. Each operation carries a cost of 1, and the goal
is to find the sequence of operations that transforms one string
into the other using the least total cost, which represents
the edit distance between the two strings.
