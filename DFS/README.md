Depth-First Search (DFS) addresses the problem of
traversing or searching all vertices of a graph by
starting from a given source and exploring as deep
as possible along one path before backtracking,
ensuring that each vertex is visited exactly once,
which makes DFS useful for tasks such as detecting
cycles, finding connected components, topological sorting,
and exploring graph structures where deep exploration is required.
