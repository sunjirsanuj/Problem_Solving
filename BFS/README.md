Breadth-First Search (BFS) addresses the problem of systematically
traversing or searching all vertices of a graph starting from a given
source vertex by visiting nodes level by level—first all directly
connected neighbors, then neighbors of those neighbors, and so on—ensuring
that each vertex is visited exactly once, which makes BFS especially
suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, checking
connectivity, and traversing all components of a graph when it may be disconnected.
