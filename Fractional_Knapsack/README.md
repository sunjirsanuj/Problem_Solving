In the Fractional Knapsack problem, we are given a set of items,
each with a certain profit and weight, along with a knapsack that
can carry a maximum weight W. The objective is to fill the knapsack
in a way that maximizes total profit, but unlike the 0/1 Knapsack,
items here can be broken into smaller fractions. This means we are
allowed to take any portion of an item if the entire item does not fit.
The task is to choose whole items or fractional parts so that the
weight limit is not exceeded while achieving the highest possible profit.
