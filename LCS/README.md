In the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem,
we are given two sequences (or strings), and the
task is to find the length of the longest subsequence
that is present in both sequences. A subsequence is a
sequence that appears in the same relative order but
not necessarily consecutively. The goal is to determine
the maximum number of elements that the two sequences have
in common while preserving their original order.
